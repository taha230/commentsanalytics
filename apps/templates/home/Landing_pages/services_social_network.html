                <p class="mb-4">
                    The first social media site to reach a million monthly active users was MySpace – it achieved this milestone around the year 2004. This is the beginning of social media till now. During some period one specific social media launched and has a dramatic rise in active user criteria. TikTok, for example, launched in September 2016 and by mid-2018 it had already reached  <a class="text-info" href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media", rel="nofollow"> half a billion users</a>. To put this in perspective: TikTok gained on average about 20 million new users per month over this period. The sudden rise in users shows the need for this platform for people to interact with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today’s total of 4.62 billion social media users is 3.1 times higher than the 1.48 billion figure we published in 2012. Social networks have a huge proportion of time spent in the day and traffic usage. At an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes per day, social media accounts for the largest single share of our connected media time, at 35 percent of the total.
                    The time we spend using social media has grown again over the past year too, up by 2 minutes per day (+1.4 percent). See the chart for more details.

                    In 2022, different social media play role in attracting active users around the world. Facebook’s monthly active users grew by 6.2 percent (+170 million users) over the past year (note that Facebook is still blocked in China).

                    YouTube has closed the gap with Facebook over the past year, with the platform’s audience growing almost twice as fast as Facebook’s.

                <h2 class="h2 d-flex mt-6">The capacity of social network</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The social networking market has been increasing at an exponential rate. This increase in demand is due to significant adoption by all age levels. Moreover, the application of social networking platforms noticed a substantial rise owing to the demand coming from the businesses which use the platforms for marketing purposes as well.
                    A social media profile is an online platform that people use to build social networks or social connections with other people who share similar personal or job interests, activities, experiences, or real-life relations. This is the answer to the question "Why do we need to find social media profiles?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the massive potential evidence available who are spending many hours a day using social media across various platforms, it is not surprising that marketers have embraced social media as a marketing channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We consider social media to be a technology-driven, but not entirely technological ecosystem in which a diverse and complex set of behaviors, interactions, and exchanges involving various kinds of interconnected actors (individuals, organizations, and institutions) can happen. <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Social%20network%20accounts%20extractor%20as%20a%20need%20for%20social%20marketers%20and%20growing%20your%20business/">Social media</a> is pervasive, widely used, and culturally relevant.
                <p>
                    This definitional perspective is deliberately broad because we believe that social media has essentially become almost anything content, information, conducts, individuals, organizations, and institutions that can live in an interconnected, networked digital environment. It has developed from being simply an online platform for behaviors and information creation and sharing. It is pervasive across countries and culturally recognized both local and global. These reasons indicated the importance of social marketing and the need for social media profile search at a large size. In this step, profile browse services come in to accelerate finding validated profile URLs.

                    First of all, we focused on the organic result of search engines to extract the updated result of profile URLs.

We have tested the different methods on accuracy of our services and reached the Accuracy of 96 percent for known queries.
