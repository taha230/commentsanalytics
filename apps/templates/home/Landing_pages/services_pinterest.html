                    Pinterest can be an interesting tool for businesses. Unlike Instagram, Pinterest offers a free dedicated <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/business/create/" , rel="nofollow", class="text-info">business account</a>, which provides additional features such as analytics and rich pins. Rich pins allow you to provide information with each pin, some of which can be extremely beneficial to your marketing efforts. Pinterest provides a "Product Pin" that is a perfect way to drive traffic to your online store. Product pins give real-time notifications, keeping users up to date on the latest price and buying options. Users can create wish lists on Pinterest, so a pin today could be a sales conversion tomorrow. Businesses often create their gift guides to make shopping that much more comfortable for their customers.  Pinterest Lens is still being developed and takes search and discovery to another level. Nowadays, the very presence of your products in someoneâ€™s home, on the feet of a passer-by, could serve as an immediate contact opportunity. Moreover, <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Business%20marketing%20on%20Pinterest/">Lens works best</a> when looking at home decor objects, but the results will get better as more people use it and expand the scope of objects Lens can recognize.

                <h2 class="h2 d-flex mt-6">Pinterest profile URLs finding</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Finding valid profile URLs of businesses and people on Pinterest is a tedious task for employees because they should search in search engines and verified databases to find the verified URLs or not. In the case of large file queries, this burdensome task is more frustrating and the need for automated services to find valid URLs is more needed. Imagine you want to find the profile URL of "IKEA" on Pinterest. You can submit your query about IKEA from the <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Single%20Request%20option%20to%20validate%20the%20quality%20of%20URL%20finding%20services/">"Single Request"</a> option. With the Single Request, you can test the validity of Pinterest URL findings. You will type "IKEA" for the Name and select "Pinterest" from dropdown menu Type and press the "Browse" button.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    After a few seconds, you can see the URL result of your query in the "Single Request History" section. If the finding process is unsuccessful, the result will be "not exist" that means that this query has not any verified Pinterest profile found by our services.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    As you can see in the "Single Requests History" the URL of <a class="text-info" href="https://www.pinterest.com/IKEAUSA/", rel="nofollow">"https://www.pinterest.com/IKEAUSA/"</a> is shown as the result of Pinterest URL finding. If you click on this url as following figure, you can go to the official page of "IKEA" on the Pinterest social network. The <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Single%20Request%20option%20to%20validate%20the%20quality%20of%20URL%20finding%20services/">"Single Request"</a> only works for limited number of queries and mostly used for accurcy validation with <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Free%20plan:%20Best%20approach%20to%20attract%20customers%20to%20purchase/">"Free Plan"</a> before purchasing the desired plans by customers.
