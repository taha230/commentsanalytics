                    <p class="lead">Key phrase extraction (also known as keyword detection or keyword analysis) is a text analysis method that automatically extracts the most used and most relevant words and phrases from a text. It helps summarize the content of texts and identify the main subjects discussed.</p>
                    <p class="lead mt-2">Keyword extraction uses machine learning artificial intelligence (ML) with natural language processing (NLP) to break down human language so that it can be understood by machines. It’s used to find keywords from all types of text: regular documents and business reports, social media comments, online forums and reviews, news reports, and more.</p>
                    <p class="lead mt-2"> For example you want to analyze thousands of online reviews about your product. Keyword extraction enables you filter through the entire set of data and obtain the words that best describe each review in few seconds. That way, you can automatically see what your customers are saying most often, saving your teams hours upon hours of manual processing. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Word cloud is another example of keyword extraction. It shows visualizations of a text’s most frequently used words in word clusters. It provide you with quick and simple visual insights that can lead to more in-depth analyses.</p>
                    <p class="lead mt-2">In other words, word clouds are a great way to visualize sentiment, creatively display live poll responses, and turn a monotonous presentation into an interactive work of art. Data visualizations (like charts, graphs, infographics, and more) give companies a useful way to communicate important information at a glance.</p>
                    <p class="lead mt-2">word cloud Also known as tag clouds or text clouds, these are ideal ways to draw the most pertinent parts of textual data, from blog posts to databases. They can also allow business users compare and contrast two different pieces of text to find the wording similarities between the two.</p>
