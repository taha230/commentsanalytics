                <p class="mb-4">
                    With nearly 3 billion monthly users, Facebook is inarguably the largest and most popular social media platform in the world. A majority of American adults — roughly 68% — report using Facebook regularly, with 51% being active on the site multiple times per day. General usage is spread evenly across all genders, and most users tend to become more active as their age increases — especially after 40 years of age.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The latest statistics show that Facebook continues to reign strong as the king of social media, with <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-july-global-statshot" , rel="nofollow", class="text-info">2.94 billion active users in 2022</a>. That means that around three out of every four of the 3.96 billion social media users are active Facebook users. 
                    Facebook’s statistics and its social media ranking say it all. Not only is it the social media platform with the most active users, but it also ranks among the most-used social media apps. 27 percent of Android users worldwide use the Facebook app daily.

                    The use of Facebook has become part of our routine. We don’t even notice it anymore. We pick up our phones, or open up our laptops, and go straight to Facebook to see what’s going on. In fact, Facebook has entered our lives so effortlessly, that at this point it’s hard to imagine a life before Facebook. Whether it’s politics or our private lives, Facebook has made information sharing easier than it ever was before. I mean, how else would you connect with your friends? Or share your stories? Or know what events to go to? Or…there is so much more that we depend on Facebook for.

                    Finding valid profile URLs of businesses and people on Facebook is a time-consuming job for employees because they should search in search engines to find the verified URLs or not. In the case of large file queries, this burdensome task is more frustrating and the need for automated services to find valid URLs is more needed. Imagine you want to find the profile URL of business such as "Trello" on Facebook. You can submit your query from the <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Single%20Request%20option%20to%20validate%20the%20quality%20of%20URL%20finding%20services/">"Single Request"</a> option.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    After a few seconds, you can see the URL result of your query in the "Single Request History" section. If the finding process is unsuccessful, the result will be "not exist" that means that this query has not any verified Facebook profile found by our Facebook profile finder service.
