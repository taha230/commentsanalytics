                        <p class="mb-4 mt-5">Pinterest is a popular image-sharing social network that enables artists to share their ideas with their connections. It has about 400 million active users worldwide. In 2015, Pinterest implemented a feature that allows users to search with images instead of words. In March 2020, Pinterest introduced the "Today" tab on the home feed that shows trending pins. Companies use Pinterest to promote their brands and designs.</p>
                        <p>In the profile browse service, you are enabled to find mass file queries that provide the URLs of your Pinterest queries. If you have a large file of companies, pins, or brands, and you want to detect their activities on Pinterest, the profile browse service is your solution to obtain your query URLs in an excel file. So, do not hesitate to start our service for free.</p>
