                <p class="mb-4">
                    The social media platform Instagram has been around for over ten years nowadays. With more than 1.2 billion users worldwide, individuals and groups from all corners of the world are sharing everything from recipes and fitness tips to memes and political messages. Earlier regarded only a way for people to record and share their daily lives, the platform is now the online spine for soft marketing for business, civil rights activism, mental health awareness, online tutorials, and more.

                <h3 class="h3 d-flex mt-6">Key Statistics:</h3>

                <ul class="list-style-none pl-4">

                    <li data-placement="left" >
                        Instagram has 500+ million daily active users (DAUs) globally, ranking it second behind Facebook for the social network with the highest daily logins.
                   </li>
                   <li data-placement="left" >
                        The company reports that 500+ million daily users interact with Instagram Stories, up from June 2018’s 400 million.
                    </li>
                   <li data-placement="left" >
                        It took Snapchat 6 years to hit 150 million daily active users, Instagram’s story usage surpassed that milestone in 8 months from launch.
                    </li>
                    <li data-placement="left" >

                </ul>


                <p class="mb-4">
                    When glancing at how many people use Instagram daily since launch, it’s clear to see that the quantity of new features they’ve added has made a big impact on the coverage of the app.
                    If we looked back in October 2016, Instagram had 550 million monthly users with only 100 million daily users, meaning only about 18% of their user base would visit the app in one day.
                    Currently, over 50% of the monthly users interact with the app daily due to some impressive user-friendly feature releases such as stories, IG TV, Live video, Instant translation, and Reels.

                <h2 class="h2 d-flex mt-6">The capacity of Instagram in Business and selling</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Instagram is a leading photo-based social media platform, but it does more than keep you up to date on your friends’ adventures. Influencers and small businesses use Instagram as a tool for audience connection, engagement, <a class="text-info" href="/Post/Using%20social%20network%20profiles%20for%20lead%20generation%20of%20your%20business/">lead generation</a>, and sales. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    <a class= "text-info" , href = "https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15861-how-to-sell-online.html" , rel="nofollow">Instagram is a great way to start selling online </a>. In November 2020, Instagram added the <a class= "text-info" , href = "https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-reels-and-shop-tabs#:~:text=With%20the%20Shop%20tab%2C%20we,new%20product%20collections%2C%20and%20more." , rel="nofollow">Shop tab</a>, allowing users to discover and purchase products from brands directly through the app. Instagram’s Shop functionality is likely a response to continuous social media and mobile shopping growth.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Of course, even for the best-known companies, success will not come overnight, but if a marketing team wants to get their association on the map, Instagram can help.
                    Businesses can boost brand awareness and reach their target audience by keeping an active presence and maintaining a routine of at least one post per day. This is how both household names like Apple and Adidas, as well as a slew of small businesses, have effectively used Instagram to succeed.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Instagram has evolved over the years to enable on-platform e-commerce sales. Today, there is a greater emphasis on making money through product placement. The latest update is the Shop tab, which is located prominently on Instagram’s home dock and allows users to discover and purchase from brands directly through Instagram. Instagram also offers shoppable posts, which allow businesses to add tags to the products in their photos with links that include a product explanation, price, and the ability to “shop now,” which will lead the user to your online store.
                    With these services, it’s straightforward for a business to attract actual sales from the site. A staggering about 70% of Instagram users reported purchasing products through the social media platform at least once the results are hard to ignore.
