Is Machine Learning Used in Sentiment Analysis?

Machine learning forms the backbone of modern sentiment analysis.

As Arthur Samuel once defined it, "Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." In sentiment analysis, this translates to systems that evolve and improve their understanding of emotions over time.
