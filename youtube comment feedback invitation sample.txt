Hello Aboulhasan! Thanks for your video. I wanted to let you know about our new-launched YouTube comments analysis tool, CommentsAnalytics. Our tool offers various features including sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, and YouTube category extraction as informative reports for analyzing your YouTube video comments. We have recently launched a new Starter Plan that includes 1000 queries, which I believe could be a great fit for your YouTube channel to test it out. We are so confident in our services that we're offering a 100% discount code for you, and all we ask for in return is your feedback. If you're interested, you can email us at info[at]commentsanalytics[dot]com or simply reply to this comment to get our 100 percent discount code for our 'Starter' plan. Thank you for considering CommentsAnalytics!
