Hello There! Thank you for the informative video. I came across a YouTube comments analysis tool, CommentsAnalytics, that might be helpful for your channel. It provides sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, and YouTube comments category extraction as informative reports. We have recently launched a new Starter Plan that includes 1000 queries, which I believe could be a great fit for your YouTube channel to test it out. We are so confident in our services that we're offering a 100% discount code for you, and all we ask for in return is your feedback. If you're interested, message me.

Dear Amin, 

We are excited to announce the launch of our new service, CommentsAnalytics, which offers a suite of powerful tools for analyzing and understanding online comments. Our services include sentiment analysis, which allows you to gauge the emotional tone of comments; YouTube comment category classification, which groups comments into categories such as Feedback, Question, Suggestion, ... ; named-entity recognition, which identifies and extracts named entities like people, places, and organizations from comments; and keyword extraction, which identifies the most important words and phrases in comments.

 As a special offer, we would like to offer you a 'FEEDBACK100' discount code for our Starter plan, which includes 1000 queries for free. We would love to hear your feedback and explore further collaboration opportunities.

[Analyzing Your recent YouTube Video Comments with CommentsAnalytics] 

Dear Austin Evans Youtube Channel Admin,

I hope this email finds you in good health. My name is Taha, an AI software developer, and an avid viewer of your YouTube channel. I am writing to share my recent analysis of your YouTube video using CommentsAnalytics - an AI tool that provides an in-depth analysis of YouTube comments, including sentiment analysis, comment categories (which include seven classes like Feedback, Question, Personal Experience, etc.), named entities recognition, and keywords extraction.

I analyzed your recent video "I bought EVERYTHING Amazon recommended" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEibYkY1nQ) and extracted insightful findings to share with you.

Here's a summary of my analysis:

* Sentiment Analysis: Positive - 24%, Neutral - 49%, Negative - 26% (Good!)
* The most frequent keywords in comments were "austin, projector, book, amazon, ..." which occurred 44, 13, 11, and 11 times with 23%, 0%, 36%, and 36% positive sentiment! (keyword cloud is attached)
* 'Feedback' was the most dominant category, with 88 comments and 18% positive sentiment.(Not Bad !!!)
I have attached detailed charts and Excel sheets with my analysis for your reference.

Our comment analysis tool offers a comprehensive solution for understanding the sentiment of your audience through advanced keyword extraction and named entity recognition.

I provided a 100 percent discount code "FEEDBACK100" for the starter plan to test it. You only need to export every single video with the Chrome extension link on top of the website.
