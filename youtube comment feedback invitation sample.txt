Hello There! Thank you for the informative video. I came across a YouTube comments analysis tool, CommentsAnalytics, that might be helpful for your channel. It provides sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, and YouTube comments category extraction as informative reports. We have recently launched a new Starter Plan that includes 1000 queries, which I believe could be a great fit for your YouTube channel to test it out. We are so confident in our services that we're offering a 100% discount code for you, and all we ask for in return is your feedback. If you're interested, message me.

Dear Amin, 

We are excited to announce the launch of our new service, CommentAnalytics, which offers a suite of powerful tools for analyzing and understanding online comments. Our services include sentiment analysis, which allows you to gauge the emotional tone of comments; YouTube comment category classification, which groups comments into categories such as Feedback, Question, Suggestion, ... ; named-entity recognition, which identifies and extracts named entities like people, places, and organizations from comments; and keyword extraction, which identifies the most important words and phrases in comments.

 As a special offer, we would like to offer you a 'FEEDBACK100' discount code for our Starter plan, which includes 1000 queries for free. We would love to hear your feedback and explore further collaboration opportunities.

Best regards,

Taha Hamedani

[Analyzing Your YouTube Video with CommentAnalytics]

Dear Brian,

I hope this email finds you in good health. My name is Taha, an AI software engineer, and an avid viewer of your YouTube channel. I am writing to share my recent analysis of your YouTube video using CommentAnalytics - an AI tool that provides an in-depth analysis of YouTube comments, including sentiment, comment categories (which include seven classes like Feedback, Question, Personal Experience, etc.), named entities, and keywords.

I analyzed your recent video "7 Tools I Use as a Developer | Day in the Life of a Software Engineer" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBk8Y4NOa4I) and extracted insightful findings to share with you.

Here's a summary of my analysis:

* Sentiment Analysis: Positive - 60%, Neutral - 37%, Negative - 1% (Great!)
* The most frequent keywords in comments were "Video, Videso, Love, Bike, ..." which occurred 24, 20, 10, and 9 times with 75%, 90%, 100%, and 56% positive sentiment! (keyword cloud is attached)
* The question was the most dominant category, with 61 comments and 31% positive sentiment.
I have attached detailed charts and Excel sheets with my analysis for your reference.

I invite you to visit commentsanalytics.com and sign up for CommentAnalytics to experience the tool yourself. As I am new to comment analysis, I would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback on my analysis and any suggestions you may have for further improvement. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Taha
