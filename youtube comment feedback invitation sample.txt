Hello There! Thank you for the informative video. I came across a YouTube comments analysis tool, CommentsAnalytics, that might be helpful for your channel. It provides sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, and YouTube comments category extraction as informative reports. We have recently launched a new Starter Plan that includes 1000 queries, which I believe could be a great fit for your YouTube channel to test it out. We are so confident in our services that we're offering a 100% discount code for you, and all we ask for in return is your feedback. If you're interested, message me.

Dear Amin, 

We are excited to announce the launch of our new service, CommentAnalytics, which offers a suite of powerful tools for analyzing and understanding online comments. Our services include sentiment analysis, which allows you to gauge the emotional tone of comments; YouTube comment category classification, which groups comments into categories such as Feedback, Question, Suggestion, ... ; named-entity recognition, which identifies and extracts named entities like people, places, and organizations from comments; and keyword extraction, which identifies the most important words and phrases in comments.

 As a special offer, we would like to offer you a 'FEEDBACK100' discount code for our Starter plan, which includes 1000 queries for free. We would love to hear your feedback and explore further collaboration opportunities.

Best regards,

Taha Hamedani
